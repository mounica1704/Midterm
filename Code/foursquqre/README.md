# Spring Social Foursquare Example

This sample app demonstrates how to use [spring-social-foursquare](https://github.com/mattupstate/spring-social-foursquare) and is based on the [spring-social-quickstart](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-samples/tree/master/spring-social-quickstart) project.

You should be able to run this application locally by performing the following steps:

#### Clone the Spring Social Foursquare project and install to your local Maven repository:

    git clone git@github.com:mattupstate/spring-social-foursquare.git
    cd spring-social-foursquare
    ./gradlew install

#### Clone the example project from github if you haven't already: 

    git clone git@github.com:mattupstate/spring-social-foursquare-example.git

#### Run the project using the Maven Tomcat plugin:

    mvn tomcat:run

At the moment, the project simply searches for venues near a location in New York City..

Perhaps you'd like to fork this and have at it yourself to test out the API! I'd love some feedback.
